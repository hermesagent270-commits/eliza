Name the matching child instead of the NOTES umbrella so its required fields reach the planner. Explicit Notes records belong here; generic requests to remember durable facts or preferences use memory, and document/file work uses documents. A note is not a todo or calendar event. Add VIEWS only when the user also requests navigation.",
