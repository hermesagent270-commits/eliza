/**
 * NOTES — the chat door onto the durable notes store.
 *
 * The notes view already exposes create/read/update/delete as view
 * capabilities, but those resolve only through PAGE_DELEGATE against an OPEN
 * view, so an agent without a UI client (a Discord/chat-only deployment) had
 * no way to reach notes at all. "make a note" then fell through to whatever
 * else matched — DATABASE hand-writing SQL, or the room-gated owner todo
 * surface — and the note was silently lost.
 *
 * This action wraps the SAME `NotesService` the view uses, so a note written
 * in chat and a note written in the app are one record in one store. It adds
 * no storage, no second source of truth, and no new persistence path.

    "writing something down for later with no time attached ('make a note', 'note to self', 'write down that …', 'jot this down', 'remember that …') -> NOTES_CREATE with content. ANY read over the user's notes -> NOTES_LIST. For a specific topic ('search my notes for X', 'find my note about X', 'do i have a note on X', 'what did my note say about X'), pass content=X so unrelated personal notes are not exposed; omit content when the owner asks for all notes, counts, or a recency comparison without a topic. Recency is determined from returned createdAt/updatedAt fields, never by searching for words such as 'latest' or 'most recently updated'. A notes search is NEVER a document search: never route it to SEARCH_DOCUMENTS, DOCUMENT, FILES or DATABASE, which do not index notes and will answer 'nothing found' for a note that exists. REMOVING one ('delete the note about X', 'forget the note about X', 'remove my note on X') -> NOTES_DELETE with content=the identifying text. CHANGING one ('change the note about X to Y', 'update my note about X') -> NOTES_UPDATE with content=the existing text and body=the replacement. Deleting and updating are NOT reads: never answer a removal or change request with NOTES_LIST. RECALLING A FACT the user once asked you to note ('who is alex again', 'what did i say about X') is answered from the SAVED_NOTES context block, which is the same store; when that block reports notes it did not show, call NOTES_LIST before answering.
