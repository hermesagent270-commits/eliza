/**
 * Pins the quality.yml concurrency contract: push runs on develop must
 * never cancel in progress. Rapid merge waves previously canceled every
 * quality run mid-flight, so lint/format reds on develop landed invisibly
 * until a release pin surfaced them (#18326, #18338, #18360). The shared
 * ref group bounds the queue at one running plus one pending run (#14069),
 * so completion cannot starve the runner fleet. Deterministic, reads the
 * real workflow file.
