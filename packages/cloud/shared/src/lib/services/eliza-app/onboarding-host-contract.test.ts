/**
 * Deployment contract for the onboarding frontend origins. The messaging
 * continuation Connect CTA (`/get-started`) and the dashboard/billing links now
 * both live on the Cloud app: the CTA opens the app's authenticated
 * `/get-started`, which sends signed-out users straight into Steward login and
 * hands back to Discord, so there is no intermediate homepage sign-in card.
 *
 * The contract is checked through effective resolution, not string presence.
 * Each case parses one deployed environment's complete `[vars]` block out of the
 * Worker config, installs it as the cloud bindings context exactly as the
 * request pipeline does, and asserts the URLs the onboarding state machine
 * actually emits. A wrong host therefore fails here even when the key is
 * present, and an origin that resolves correctly through a fallback is not
 * reported as a gap. Real resolver, real config, in-memory session store.
