 *   - `not_ready` — the probe REACHED the container (SSH transport worked and
 *     the remote shell ran) but it was still not answering healthy when the
 *     budget ran out. A genuine "the container isn't up" verdict.
 *   - `transport_unresolved` — the budget was exhausted while EVERY probe
 *     attempt failed at the SSH transport layer (connect/exec/stream error or
 *     command timeout). The probe never reached a verdict about the container,
 *     so concluding "not ready" here would be a FALSE NEGATIVE — the exact
 *     split-brain that marks a healthy container failed and wedges its row.
 *     Callers should treat this as RETRYABLE, not terminal.
