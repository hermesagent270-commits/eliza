# headscale (Eliza Cloud coordination server — ACL source of truth)

Self-hosted [headscale](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale) coordination
server for the Eliza Cloud tailnet. It coordinates internal agent containers
(`tag:agent`) and, historically, customer tunnels sold by
`@elizaos/plugin-elizacloud`; the tags cohabit through ACL-tag isolation.

Headscale runs on the **Hetzner control-plane VM** (see [`DEPLOY.md`](./DEPLOY.md)).
The previous Railway-hosted runtime was removed on 2026-06-17, along with its
`Dockerfile`, `entrypoint.sh`, `railway.toml`, `config.yaml`, and the
`cloud-headscale.yml` deploy workflow. This directory is now the committed source
of truth for the **ACL policy** (`acl.hujson`), which the Hetzner arm workflow
deploys to `/etc/headscale/acl.hujson`.

## Tag namespaces (load-bearing safety boundary)

| Tag | Used by | Reach |
|---|---|---|
| `tag:agent` | Internal agent containers (set in [`headscale-integration.ts`](../../shared/src/lib/services/headscale-integration.ts#L262)) | Internal services only — must NOT reach customer tunnels. |
| `tag:eliza-tunnel` | Customer tunnel sessions minted by [`auth-key/route.ts`](../../api/v1/apis/tunnels/tailscale/auth-key/route.ts) | The reverse proxy and the customer's own node. Cross-customer routing is enforced by the proxy lookup layer. |
| `tag:eliza-proxy` | The public reverse proxy node and the control plane's own `cp-<env>-router` | Customer tunnel HTTPS endpoints, plus the agent fleet on the container port only (`tag:agent:2138`) for bridge and health traffic. |

The exact ACL policy lives in `acl.hujson` next to this README. **Edit there, not in the headscale admin UI** — the file is committed and deployed.

Customer tunnel provisioning is gated by the Cloud API route
`POST /api/v1/apis/tunnels/tailscale/auth-key`. The route requires an Eliza
Cloud user or API key with an active organization, debits org credits once per
successful provisioning, mints a short-lived non-reusable key tagged
`tag:eliza-tunnel`, and returns a signed generated
`eliza-<org>-<random>-<expiry>-<signature>` hostname for the tunnel proxy. The
proxy rejects signed hostnames after their embedded expiry, so public tunnel
URLs do not become permanent reusable aliases.

## Deploy

Headscale is armed on the Hetzner control-plane VM by
`arm-headscale-control-plane.yml` / `packages/cloud/scripts/admin/arm-headscale-control-plane.mjs`,
which writes this directory's `acl.hujson` to the host, converges
`/etc/headscale/config.yaml`, ensures the `agent` and `tunnel` users, and
upserts the Worker-facing env. During the eliza.app migration it also serves the
canonical and legacy exact hostnames from one explicitly verified TLS
certificate while keeping the canonical URL authoritative inside Headscale.
The protected workflow fixes API/listen values to environment-specific loopback
constants, fails on any competing loaded nginx owner, and proves both public
SNI names return the same exact dual-SAN leaf before it succeeds.
Full checklist + required GitHub Environment values are in
[`DEPLOY.md`](./DEPLOY.md). The `HEADSCALE_API_KEY` is generated on the host and
stored as a GitHub/Worker secret — never pasted into issues or workflow inputs.

## Local dev

A `docker-compose.yml` for headscale is intentionally NOT included in `cloud/docker-compose.yml` — local dev uses the `tag:agent` flow only and doesn't touch customer-tunnel pricing. To exercise customer tunnels locally, point `HEADSCALE_API_URL` at a development instance you stand up by hand.
