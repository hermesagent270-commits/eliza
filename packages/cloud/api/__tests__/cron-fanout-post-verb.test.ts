/**
 * Generic cron-wiring guard (#22508).
 *
 * `makeCronHandler` dispatches every fanned-out path with `method: "POST"`, so
 * a route that only registers `app.get("/")` 404s on every scheduled tick and
 * the job silently never runs. Three routes had been failing that way in
 * production (cleanup-webhook-events,
 * compute-metrics) plus cleanup-expired-crypto-payments, because no test
 * asserted the invariant across the whole map.
 *
 * This drives the REAL dispatcher over the REAL `CRON_FANOUT` against the REAL
 * route modules, and asserts no path answers 404. The env deliberately carries
 * no CRON_SECRET, so `requireCronSecret` fails closed inside every handler
 * before it can touch a service or the database — the only thing under test is
 * whether Hono matched the POST.
