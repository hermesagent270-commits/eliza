/**
 * Dashboard-only inline markers.
 *
 * Some single-line markers in agent reply text are rendered exclusively by the
 * dashboard chat surface and mean nothing anywhere else — `[CONFIG:<pluginId>]`
 * becomes a plugin setup card (see packages/ui message-parser-helpers). They
 * are NOT part of the interaction-block grammar, so `parseInteractionBlocks`
 * deliberately leaves them in `cleanedText` — which means every non-dashboard
 * connector that renders from cleanedText leaks them verbatim into chat
 * (live: `[CONFIG:google_calendars]` delivered raw over api/chat replies,
 * Finding B at HQ #18309).
 *
 * The canonical interaction parser strips them only from its connector-facing
 * `cleanedText`; it never mutates the original content consumed by the
 * dashboard. The pattern mirrors the dashboard's own CONFIG_RE exactly so the
 * two projections agree about what constitutes a marker.
