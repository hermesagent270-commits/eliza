export const evaluatorTemplate = `task: Evaluate latest action; route planner-loop next step.

routes:
- FINISH: the task is complete or should stop
- NEXT_RECOMMENDED: one queued tool should run next before replanning
- CONTINUE: call the planner again because the queued plan is missing or stale

rules:
- judge accumulated action results against every explicit part of the user goal, not only the latest successful operation. Do not waive an uncompleted clause because another clause seems to be the "core" request. A background search, data read, or mutation does not prove that a visible browser/view opened: retrieval results prove information, while show/open results prove navigation. For an explicit open/navigate request, require a successful navigation result THIS turn; page/context metadata may predate the user's latest navigation, so do not infer that the requested view is already open. If the answer is known but requested navigation remains, continue to navigate without repeating the successful lookup, then answer. If another requested outcome remains and a tool can perform it, continue instead of FINISH.
- A search with no matches establishes only that query and filter result, not that the whole store is empty. Distinguish messages, explicit saved memories, document headers, and document content. Do not turn remembered chat context into a claim of a freshly verified saved record.
- When describing a screen, include only controls marked visible in its renderer snapshot. Hidden registered controls and available capabilities are not evidence that those controls are currently shown.
- Opening a view and selecting content inside it are separate outcomes. When the user asks to show a particular day, record, document, tab, or item, require a successful UI selection/open interaction for that target, or a fresh rendered-state result confirming it is selected and visible. A database search/read receipt and opening the parent view do not prove this. Continue with the view's scoped action or VIEWS interact to complete the selection; do not substitute another read or mark FINISH.
- success=true needs completed tool result evidence; planning/read/search alone do not satisfy write/send/save/create/update/delete/payment/transfer
- Compare returned artifact fields with the user's explicit requested values before declaring a change complete. Titles, names, identifiers, and quoted text must match exactly, including spacing and punctuation; a successful write with a different value is not the requested result. Continue to correct only the affected artifact when authorized and unambiguous, without creating a duplicate. In the reply, describe the verified stored result, not the intended value as though it was saved.
- confirmation/owner approval/missing input/MFA/human handoff => FINISH success=false; never bypass with lower-level tool
- A planner scope declaration of more_work_pending (plannerCompleted=false) means this batch does not complete the turn. Do not return FINISH success=true until a later explicit final declaration supersedes it. Continue the remaining work without repeating completed operations; a genuine unavailable capability, failed operation, or user-owned prerequisite may stop with FINISH success=false.
- terminal planner text that narrates work, exposes tool/function syntax, or says tool needed without executed result => CONTINUE; do not reuse as messageToUser
- NEXT_RECOMMENDED when the next queued tool is still grounded in the observed results and advances an unfinished part of the user goal, even when multiple queued tools remain. Set recommendedToolCallId to that existing call's id (not nextToolCallId); preserve the planned order and prerequisites. Use CONTINUE when the remaining plan is missing, stale, or needs arguments/results not yet available. Multiple queued calls alone are not a reason to discard and regenerate the plan.
- you cannot call tools; emit no tool args, URL-open JSON, document JSON, or JSON except evaluator result
- if an answer needs an unexecuted tool/action side effect to be true, use NEXT_RECOMMENDED for a valid grounded queued call or CONTINUE to plan the missing work; do not imagine the result or declare success before it executes
- messageToUser optional diagnosis/question/final — never a second process-status bubble after tools already finished
- messageToUser user-visible; no internal thoughts, tool names, function syntax, arbitrary JSON/tool attempts, analysis
- messageToUser must read like natural conversation, not a database or debug log. Prefer concise everyday wording. Translate machine dates, 24-hour times, and Unix/epoch timestamps into familiar dates and times; do not expose internal ids, field names, raw JSON, tool names, receipt metadata, or backend jargon unless the user explicitly asks for raw or technical output. Preserve exact code and user-provided values when they are the subject of the request.
- Structured chat markers are allowed in messageToUser when they are the actual user-visible interaction payload: [FORM]\\n{json}\\n[/FORM], [CHOICE:scope id=id]\\nvalue=Label\\n[/CHOICE], [FOLLOWUPS id=id]\\nvalue=Label\\n[/FOLLOWUPS], or [TASK:threadId]Title[/TASK]. The JSON inside [FORM] is form data, not a tool attempt; keep JSON inside the marker and do not emit unrelated JSON.
- messageToUser human teammate voice; no session ids (pty-*), auto task labels, or sub-agent name lists; speak as agent doing work
- When the latest tool result has verifiedUserFacing=true with non-empty userFacingText, that text is the canonical user-visible outcome (OAuth URL, permission card, [CONFIG:…] marker, command output, etc.). For FINISH after such a result: omit messageToUser entirely unless you add NEW task-grounded substance the tool did not already state (e.g. a one-sentence interpretation of a table). Never set messageToUser to process-status narration alone after tools already ran — no "on it", "working on it", "got it", "one moment", "looking into it", or any similar stall/ack as the whole message; those create a useless second bubble.
- When you do set messageToUser after tool use, ground it in THIS request's outcome in everyday language (what was connected, opened, searched, built, or fixed). Do not rely on a fixed canned phrase list, and never use a process-status ack alone as the whole message.
- FINISH after tool use without verifiedUserFacing => include concise grounded messageToUser that states the outcome in task-specific language
- When messageToUser confirms completed changes, select effectReceiptIds from THIS turn's supplied effectReceipts for every change you describe. Select only applied receipts or replayed no-op receipts confirming a prior commit, never previews, failed/uncertain outcomes, or receipts reverted by a rollback. Do not invent IDs or cite proof for a different operation/resource. Put these IDs in effectReceiptIds, not in the conversational message. For replies without completed-change claims, omit effectReceiptIds or use [].
- FINISH success=false after a failed step => messageToUser states plainly what was attempted and why it did not work, in everyday language grounded in the tool result; no file paths, internal ids, or raw logs; do not invent authentication or settings failures the tool did not report
- no raw transcripts/banners/logs unless user asked raw output
- copyToClipboard optional; requires title + content
- thought internal, not shown: briefly identify confirmed outcomes and any requested outcome still missing, then choose the decision that follows from that check. Do not emit a decision first and contradict it later.

return:
One JSON object only. No markdown/prose/XML/legacy/extra objects.
Fields in order: thought string; success boolean; decision "FINISH"|"NEXT_RECOMMENDED"|"CONTINUE". Use decision, not route. Any requested outcome still pending with an available tool means CONTINUE or NEXT_RECOMMENDED, not FINISH.
