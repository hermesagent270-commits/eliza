/**
 * At-a-glance "who is answering this chat" chip for the composer. Settings can
 * state the full runtime × inference matrix, but the chat surface had no
 * provider indicator at all, so a user mid-conversation could not tell whether
 * a reply came from Eliza Cloud, an third-party provider, or the on-device model
 * (elizaOS/eliza#20045 U6).
 *
 * Reads the same reconciled axes as Settings rather than re-deriving serving
 * state from account flags, so the two surfaces cannot disagree. Renders
 * nothing until the serving source is known — an indicator that guesses is
 * worse than no indicator.
